# Car Rental Website

## Overview
- This project is a car rental reservation system for a premier car rental agency. The system must require the staff to enter their assigned username and password before using the system. Upon login, the system should display the user’s actual name on the system’s user interface.

## Features
1. **Reservation** 
- Staff can check the availability of the car and make a reservation for a particular date.
Upon successful reservation, the reservation number is provided to the customer. This 
reservation number is required for changes to an existing reservation and to validate 
the customer's identity when they pick up their rental vehicle.

2. **Change/Update Reservation**
- Customers may modify their reservation if they would like to book a different date. The 
system then has to verify that the unit is available before making any changes to the 
reservation.

3. **Cancel Reservation**
- A customer may cancel the reservation for a reserved car rental. The customer must 
provide the reservation ID so that staff members can retrieve the reservation 
information in the system.
